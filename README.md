## Hi,
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects such as:
  - pdf-processing in both Python and Shell (Bash)
  - Data retrieval from LSEG using Python
  - Scientific projects using R such as e.g. evaluation of ESG
  - Head teacher of a master's course in scientific methods
    - Where I also am holding seminars for performing event studies and portfolio sorts using R
